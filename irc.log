the most frustrating thing about css3 so far is that it isn't fully supported. *shakes fist at i.e. and to a lesser degree the other three*
Part of it is learning how to write it so that degrades correctly
That and using vendor prefixes
vendor prefixes, eh? This sounds like a job for google.
for example:
-webkit-box-shadow: … ;
-moz-box-shadow: … ;
box-shadow: … ;
Writing them in that order
Vendor prefixes are also pretty hotly debated online, so… look out for that.
A lot of "vendor prefixes are LITERALLY hitler" all the way to "vendor prefixes are given to us by Jesus"
SASS actually should put most of that stuff in there for you though
Or such is my understanding
